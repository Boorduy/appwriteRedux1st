inside src we create an app called .env

these environment variables are very important at that point of time
so that sensitive information aren't exposed in the github and all that

and another app .env.sample

create an account on appwrite

after creating account learn how to read docs on https://appwrite.io/docs

there are alot of major things used here like Databases,
Functions, Auth, Storage

this project we work on Auth(authentication) , Databases, and Storage.

create project and get unique id.
 then go to .env ANND Write whats below

 REACT_APP_APPWRITE_URL=
REACT_APP_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=66dee36b00045538b662

then go to the website in add a platform click web
then itll ask for name go to package.json in our example
"name": "my-vit-project",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "type": "module"

  and 

  for domain name make sure u set it very properly
  or else when u deploy on vercel or netlify sub domain 
  it'll cause core errors

  all it requires localhost

  then it tells us to install appwrite and

  import { Client } from 'appwrite';

  then click on next... then it tells us to initialize

  const client = new Client();

client
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('66dee36b00045538b662');

go to .env and fill the other one


REACT_APP_APPWRITE_URL=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
REACT_APP_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=66dee36b00045538b662
then click on next

but we also need 

REACT_APP_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=

and in databases collections can be found so also another

REACT_APP_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID=

and

REACT_APP_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID=

it is the storage we're gonna work with.

we are on overview page go to Databases then click on create
Database. any name we want we can call it. id will be given automatically
then copy data base id into .env
once we're inside database we need to create a collection in
that page.

i create the database in name of Database and a collection inside
it named posts

now inside posts after we coppied the ids into our env we need
to add some attributes.

there are alot of options like string boolean integer float datetime
Email IP Enum Relationship

most times we will use string for attribute key we set title
he said for size use what u want but default he went 255

255 default for how much character can be in our title and we tick
the required that the user is required to do these then create
then another string named content

another string called featuredImage that will store the url of our image.

then for next one we can create it as string or boolean. ill go with
boolean to be opposite of his. named status

another string we add called userID

now we learn how we can make queries with the databases.

other than attributes we have indexes. go and create index
named status. index type Key. attribute status then press create.

we can create queries using just attributes but we get more advantage
using indexes.

now for the bucket id

go to the setting section to see who can have permission to add these
documents. not anyone can come and do that we need to give permission to
users(already logged in). it'll automatically wire these things.

we click on add role then all Users. permission goes in order
of crud. we give all permission then press update.

we will talk about Functions another video now we go to storage
text file.


on vercel.app or .netlify.app (this one is with warcell)
