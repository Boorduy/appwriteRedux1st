go to Storage press on create Bucket. i named it as bucket

and after filling .env codes go to .env.sample and fill it aswell

REACT_APP_APPWRITE_URL=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
REACT_APP_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=
REACT_APP_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=
REACT_APP_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID=
REACT_APP_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID=

inside src create folder conf and inside that create
conf.js

const conf = {
    appwriteUrl: String(process.env.REACT_APP_APPWRITE_URL),
}

export default conf

value of appwriteUrl will be String() we access data by 
process.env.what we want.

conf.js:
const conf = {
    appwriteUrl: String(process.env.REACT_APP_APPWRITE_URL),
    appwriteProjectID: String(process.env.REACT_APP_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID),
    appwriteDatabaseID: String(process.env.REACT_APP_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID),
    appwriteCollectionID: String(process.env.REACT_APP_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID),
    appwriteBucketID: String(process.env.REACT_APP_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID)
}
//this simple export helps save so much of time and trouble.

// if we face a problem its all in here and in major projects and big
//companies this is a common practice

export default conf

now setup for next video go to src create new folder called
appwrite. we create a file called auth.js

we studied a lil of appwrite. we want to create these services.
when we work with these type of applications specially backend as a
service. we want to create a service file that encapsulates the details
how registration works. someone that uses our application shouldnt worry about that
he should see this that they provide email and password or photo and
we register them as a user. what we do in the internal detail should be hidden
or abrstracted from the user.

another advantage doing this approach is maybe we're working react native
or another application we can re use this exact same code and use it. its a
good practice that we can reuse this code.


we removed this cause we implemented them in class and now we're gonna go deeper.

const client = new Client()
    //use setEndpoint( 'https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1' ) as api endpoint if it failed.
    .setProject(conf.appwriteProjectID); // Your project ID

const account = new Account(client);

we created auth.js and now we're going to use storage of appwrite to see how things work.
